We were all left craving more when the final bell rang at the end of the epic first encounter between Joseph Parker and Martin Bakole in Saudi Arabia last October. Thankfully, we haven’t had to wait too long to see two of the most incredible light heavyweights of this generation reignite their rivalry. 

How to watch Artur Beterbiev vs Dmitry Bivol 2: Date, time, fight card & more info TV Guide & Streaming Saudi Arabia is set to stage the greatest boxing card ever this February We were all left craving more when the final bell rang at the end of the epic first encounter between Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol in Saudi Arabia last October. Thankfully, we haven’t had to wait too long to see two of the most incredible light heavyweights of this generation reignite their rivalry. Beterbiev vs Bivol 2 takes place on Saturday, February 22, at the same venue as the first encounter - the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh. All four major light heavyweight world title belts are back on the line, and we are salivating at the prospect already.

While the first match-up between Beterbiev and Bivol was a memorable one, the shine was taken off the bout a tad, with a vocal number surprised by the judges’ cards, despite Beterbiev’s strong finish. It was a close fight, and although one judge scored it a draw, the other two ringside markers gave it to Beterbiev, one by 4 rounds, hence the majority decision win. In claiming victory, the Montreal resident became the first undisputed light-heavyweight champion since Roy Jones Jr. held all the belts in 2002.

Both men have scores to settle from the first encounter. Bivol is gunning for revenge, having lost his IBO world light heavyweight belt and his unbeaten record. Beterbiev, on the other hand, claimed the victory and all the belts, but he failed to win by stoppage for the first time in his career & he didn’t convince the boxing world that he was the best.

Riyadh’s February 22 card is vying for being the best card staged ever. Beterbiev v Bivol 2 may be the headline attraction, but there’s a glittering array of gems throughout the night. There are two additional world title fights: Carlos Adames vs Hamzah Sheeraz & Shakur Stevenson vs Floyd Schofield. If that’s not enough, three ‘interim’ belts are up for grabs in the following match-ups: Vergil Ortiz Jr vs Israil Madrimov, Zhilei Zhang vs Agit Kabayel and Joshua Buatsi vs Callum Smith. Unfortunately, the scheduled IBF heavyweight world title fight between Daniel Dubois and Joseph Parker has been called off, due to Dubois falling ill during fight week

Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol return to the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which staged their first encounter, too. The venue only opened its doors in 2023, and Dmitry Bivol fought on the first boxing card held there, beating Lyndon Arthur to claim the IBO light heavyweight world title (December 2023).

Away from boxing, the Saudi Pro League football side, Al Hilal, has played fixtures regularly at the arena since the start of January last year, and it can seat 30,000 spectators when set up in its football configuration.
